        "*   <u>**Do you need to know programming?**</u>: You definitely do not. Any programing concept or terminology that will be required for the course will be taught on the day of the exercise. Having said that, considering the speed of the course, the students are expected to practice at home to keep up with more advanced concepts.\n",
        "*   <u>**Will I be asked to code in the exam?**</u>: Yes and no. There will be questions related to the exercise in the exam. However, you would not have to write an entire python script but rather write pseudo code. Or you might be asked to find the error in a piece of code. The concepts from the homeworks and the lectures are more important to the exam.\n",
